Creating a Streamlit application to forecast energy delivery for the next three months based on your time series model is an excellent idea. Here's a high-level process to accomplish this:
High-Level Process for Streamlit Forecasting Application

Set Up Project Structure

Create a new directory for your Streamlit app
Set up a virtual environment and install necessary packages (streamlit, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, etc.)
Create a requirements.txt file for dependency management


Create Main App File

Implement the main Streamlit interface
Add file upload functionality to accept CSV input
Include basic UI elements like headers, instructions, and sections


Data Processing Module

Create functions to validate, clean, and preprocess uploaded CSV data
Ensure the data format matches what your model expects
Handle missing values and data type conversions


Model Implementation

Extract the STL-ARIMA model implementation from your existing code
Create functions to train the model on the uploaded data
Implement the forecast logic for the 3-month horizon


Visualization Component

Create functions to generate plots of historical data and forecasts
Implement interactive visualization options
Format results for easy interpretation


Results Display

Present forecast results in tables and charts
Include metrics on forecast confidence/accuracy
Provide downloadable forecast data


Deployment

Package the app for deployment
Deploy to a platform like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or internal servers



Let me outline a more detailed implementation approach:


Additional Enhancements

Model Customization

Add options for users to adjust forecast parameters (e.g., seasonality period, ARIMA order)
Allow users to choose between different models


Interactive Features

Add sliders for adjusting growth factors or EV adoption rates
Enable zooming and panning on charts


Scenario Analysis

Allow users to define different scenarios (e.g., rapid EV adoption vs. conservative)
Compare forecasts across multiple scenarios


Confidence Intervals

Add confidence intervals to forecasts
Visualize prediction uncertainty


Anomaly Detection

Highlight anomalies in historical data
Provide explanations for outliers



This approach leverages your existing time series analysis work and makes it accessible through an interactive web application that government representatives can use without needing to understand the underlying code.
